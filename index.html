            <div>
                I have over 4 years of experience as a Software engineer for clients in the Health Care and Banking sectors,
                with a proven track record in areas such as Project Management, Change and Release, Incident and Problem Management, 
                as well as application development. In addition, I am currently attending a software development course to further enhance
                my skills. I excel in front-end web development and am highly proficient in a range of programming languages and tools. 
                Whether working independently or collaboratively, I am capable of delivering results even under demanding
                circumstances.
